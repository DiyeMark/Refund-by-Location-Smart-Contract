## Overview
The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for example an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employeeâ€™s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.  

If, at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.

## Approach
We will have an Admin Web App that will interact with a smart contract to handle all necessary admin functionalities. On the other hand we will have a client/employee Mobile Application that will handle all the necessary interactions with smart contract from the client side.
